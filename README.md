# Alleyway---StarField-Jacket

A lightweight jacket that turns into a glowing night sky!

A single WS2812B LED strip is embedded inside the back lining, powered by a 3.7 V LiPo battery and controlled by an Arduino Nano.
The LEDs shimmer in randomized patterns, creating a soft “starfield” glow that moves as you do.
All components are hidden inside the jacket and held in place with electrical and duct tape.
